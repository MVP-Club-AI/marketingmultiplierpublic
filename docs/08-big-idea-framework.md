# The Big Idea Framework

## What Is a Big Idea?

Few people know this, but Steve Jobs secretly feared that the "Think Different" campaign would lead the press to skewer him as an egomaniac who'd gone off the rails. But he had the courage to trust his gut, buck the best practices advice, and come out swinging with a big idea.

If you want to be a great business storyteller and win people's attention and loyalty, you need a **big idea**--the bold, refreshing perspective you bring to the world. It's how you differentiate yourself to people inside your company and outside of it in the market. It's how you escape the hamster wheel of empty-calorie viral content and resonate deeply with your audience, sticking in their minds. It's inspired by your muse, informed by your taste, and born from your passion and conviction. A big idea is provocative and cuts against the grain, contrasting the best practices and conventional wisdom in your industry.

Jobs's big idea was that the way back for Apple wasn't to sell specs; it was to sell a worldview, framing Apple as the tool for creative nonconformists who move the world forward. He told a story that made people feel more creative just by placing their hands on an Apple product. That story remains at the heart of the Apple brand today. While they've introduced other brand campaigns since--like "I'm a Mac"--"Think Different" remains the tagline most associated with the brand today. Like all truly great big ideas, "Think Different" was built to last.

### Why Big Ideas Matter

A big idea isn't only for legendary founders like Jobs or business writers. Today almost everyone needs a big idea, whether you're a writer, founder, or an operations manager. Work is changing rapidly. The era of the "company man" is dead. Across nearly all industries, the average tenure of employees has plummeted; in Big Tech, it's less than three years. An increasing number of workers are giving up full-time employment altogether to go freelance or "fractional," the post-pandemic term for executives selling pieces of their time to the highest bidder.

In this new age of work, most knowledge workers are free agents. Communicating what you stand for and building a loyal following is no longer optional; it's how you give yourself true career security, even if you work in finance or HR. In a world where job-hopping and fractional work are the most reliable ways to maximize your earnings, you need to consistently market yourself as a trusted voice in your field.

**Big ideas are finite.** There are only so many great big ideas in your industry, and you want to lay claim to yours before someone else does. They're also powerful; AI can remix existing ideas in interesting ways, but it lacks the perspective and taste to truly develop something new. Your big idea is the foundation of your personal platform. It informs all the stories you tell. And it empowers you to stand out in a world of half-baked ideas and AI "workslop."

### The Problem with Commoditized Content

Most content falls short for a simple reason: It's commoditized. Common approaches include:

- "We want to start a podcast and interview leaders in our industry."
- "We want to create content like [X Competitor]--our agency created this spreadsheet of their most popular content, and we're using it to create our content calendar."
- "We had ChatGPT analyze top-performing LinkedIn posts so we can go viral."

A podcast in which you interview people in your industry is commoditized. Everyone has this idea, and there are already hundreds of versions of this podcast decaying in the dark corners of Spotify. Copycat content strategies are commoditized; anyone can do it, especially in the AI age. And commoditized content is destined to fail. If something works for your competitor, it's unlikely to work for you because you're not delivering any unique value to your target audience. Sure, you may be able to occasionally rack up likes by posting a meme or regurgitating the latest AI hype, but the impact will be superficial. If you want people to remember you, you need a big idea that resonates with people.

## The Five-Step Process

Big ideas don't come instantly, but there's a simple five-step process to develop and refine them:

1. **Passion (obsession):** What do you nerd out over at work?
2. **Lens (belief):** What truth in the world do you see that others miss?
3. **Promise (change):** What happens if we adopt your lens?
4. **Story (distillation):** The narrative that communicates your lens and promise.
5. **Tagline (hook):** The pithy turn of phrase that makes your big idea sticky.

## Your Big Idea (Work in Progress)

### Step 1: Passion (Obsession)

**What your company nerds out over:**

[Fill in your company's core passion. What gets your team excited? What do you talk about when no one's paying you to? What's the thing you can't stop thinking about?]

**The obsession:** [Fill in the one-line version of this passion]

**The core tension:** [Fill in the tension between your passion and the market reality]

### Step 2: Lens (Belief)

**What truth your company sees that others miss:**

[Fill in your unique perspective. What do you believe about your industry that goes against conventional wisdom? What do most people get wrong?]

### Step 3: Promise (Change)

**What happens when people adopt this lens:**

[Fill in the transformation. What changes for your customers when they see the world through your lens? What becomes possible?]

### Step 4: Story (Distillation)

**The narrative:**

[Fill in your big idea story in 2-3 paragraphs. This should flow naturally, communicate your lens, and deliver on your promise. Write it as if you're explaining your perspective to someone at a dinner party.]

### Step 5: Tagline (Hook)

**Candidate taglines (not yet finalized):**

- [Fill in tagline option 1]
- [Fill in tagline option 2]
- [Fill in tagline option 3]
- [Fill in tagline option 4]
