## Using These Pillars

- **Aim for balance:** Each pillar should be covered at least once every 2 weeks
- **Avoid overuse:** If a pillar has 6+ posts in 30 days, diversify
- **Match to voice:** Each founder has natural affinity for certain pillars
- **Stay flexible:** Breaking the pattern for timely topics is fine
